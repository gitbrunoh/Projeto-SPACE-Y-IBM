# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction. IBM DS Capstone Project.
The commercial space age became true and companies are making affordable space travels.

The SPACEX Falcon 9 is the worldâ€™s first orbital class reusable rocket. Reusability allows SpaceX to refly the most expensive parts of the rocket, which in
turn drives down the cost of space access.

The DS department of our fictional company (SPACEY) is responsable for predicting whenever a SPACEX first stage will be landed
successfully. These predictions are going to help us determine our future pricing.
